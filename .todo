Todo:
  ☐ Add content for interior pages
  ☐ Determine color palette for site, especially background colors
  ☐ Add documentation to nav and decide whether to have documentation as part of this site or as a branch on the main neatline respo
  ☐ Pull in all images from neatline.org docs, and decide whether to redo folder structure so it is sane and doesn't bear the traces of WP media structure
  ☐ switch out the hotchkiss from carousel
  ☐ try taking tagline out of logo, or otherwise give logo more space top and border-bottom
  ☐ use dark texture on footer, find other textures which go well together for bands of content
  ☐ constrain size of svg on larger viewports
  ☐ Add link/button to download Neatline
  ☐ Standardize placement of download links with plugins
