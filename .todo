Todo:
  ☐ Determine color palette for site, especially background colors
  ☐ Add documentation to nav and decide whether to have documentation as part of this site or as a branch on the main neatline respo
  ☐ Pull in all images from neatline.org docs, and decide whether to redo folder structure so it is sane and doesn't bear the traces of WP media structure
  ☐ switch out the hotchkiss from carousel
  ☐ try taking tagline out of logo, or otherwise give logo more space top and border-bottom
  ☐ Add link/button to download Neatline
  ☐ Standardize placement of download links with plugins
  ☐ demo image styles are not mobile first. they have a min-height of 420px. fixing this may involve reworking the markup to be able to apply styles to the image rather than relying on background image size
  ☐ update about and credit text, especially to match new team, people gone
