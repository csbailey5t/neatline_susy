<p>A collection of letters written by Civil War cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss and housed in the Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia includes a fascinating and unusual document. Four days after the Battle of Fredericksburg, Hotchkiss wrote a short letter to his daughter Nelly. After a describing the journey to rejoin the Confederate army and the natural surroundings of his campsite on the banks of the Rappahannock, Hotchkiss provides Nelly with a terse, understated description of the battle.</p>
<p>On the third page of the letter, Hotchkiss sketches out a rough drawing of the battlefield, penciling in the shape of the river around the Fredericksburg basin, positions of the armies, locations of artillery batteries, and the layout of the roads, railroads, and streams around the town. In this exhibit, we have cut away the section of the letter containing the map, georeferenced it against a stylized, modern-geography tileset, and layered the rest of the document around it.</p>
<p>Custom vector illustrations show the physical relationship between the rectified map and the rest of the letter, and the letter is transcribed with pop-up bubbles on a sentence-by-sentence basis. A collection of numbered waypoints unfold a long-format essay that describes the letter and its context in detail, and the sketch of the battle is spatially annotated and connected with content in the surrounding letter.</p>
<p>Most interesting, though, is the relationship between Hotchkiss's sketch and formal battle maps that were made of the same events. Scroll the timeline back to the "Sketch of the Battle of Fredericksburg, December 13," and an official map of the battle with a whole new set of waypoints and prose narrative is layered on top of Hotchkiss's sketch. Zoom in and move the timeline back and forth to compare the two maps in detail.</p>

<p>In this exhibit, David McClure sets side by side contemporary satellite imagery and two images taken by the Gemini missions of Baja California Sur. The positioning of the images, in combination with McClure's own annotations and vector graphics, highlights the remarkably different orientations evident in the images and the effects of each on the appearance of Baja California Sur.</p>

<p>Fought about six months after the disastrous Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville was one of a series of stringing defeats that rocked the Union army in 1862 and 1863. Hotchkiss played a critical role in one of the most well-known tactical maneuvers of the war: Lee and Jackson used his sketches of the roads and logging trails in the dense forest around Chancellorsville to plan a risky, 14-mile flanking march that put Jackson into position to launch a devastating attack on the right wing of Hooker's army.</p>
<p>Hotchkiss made dozens of maps of the area, and continued to revise and annotate them throughout his life. UVa's Small Special Collections Library holds a series of three identical printings of the map that Hotchkiss marked with colored pencils to indicate troop movements over the course of the three-day battle.</p>
<p>Each of the maps has been georeferenced, tagged with temporal visibility intervals, and annotated with a complex series of illustrations and waypoints. Follow the numbered locations to read a detailed description of the battle, and click on geometric vector shapes for information about Hotchkiss's markings and specific events in the battle. Drag the timeline back and forth to switch contexts between May 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. On the right of the screen, an ordered series of timestamped labels provides a high-level overview of the narrative.</p>

<p>Frances Henshaw's 1823 <em>Book of Penmanship Executed at the Middlebury Female Academy</em> is imaginatively and artistically remarkable. But this 14-year-old girl's textually-derived maps and cartographically-arranged texts also provide some of our best direct evidence for the teaching practices of famed women's educational reformer Emma Willard. Willard founded Henshaw's school at a time when geography was taught almost entirely through prose, and there she developed a new, visual and experimental pedagogy, based on drawing exercises and work with printed maps.</p><p>Emma Willard asserted her own impact on spatial and historical understanding in the early American republic unblushingly: "In history," she wrote, "I have invented the map."</p>
<p>This work-in-progress site demonstrates how Neatline can fit into an existing Omeka collection. It currently includes three separate Neatline exhibits.</p>

<p>In addition to built-in integration with georeferenced historical maps, Neatline can also be used as a general-purpose mapping tool to create interactive exhibits on modern-geography base layers. This exhibit is a reinvention of the standard-issue university campus map: each of the major buildings on the historic Central Grounds at the University of Virginia is outlined and annotated with a short historical description. Neatline was developed by the research and development group at the UVa Library Scholars' Lab. Our offices are indicated by an overlayed, semi-transparent image dropped over the west wing of Alderman Library.</p>

<small>By <strong>David McClure</strong> | Photographs by David McClure.</small>

<p>Pic d'Anie (2,507 m) is the first non-trivial climbing target on a eastbound traverse of the Pyrenees along the Pyrenean High Route, a walking route that follows the center ridgeline between France and Spain. Just a few miles into the Parc National des Pyrénées, Anie benefits aesthetically from contrast with the rolling gentle, hills of the Basque country to the east. Although not particularly large or technically challenging, Anie is an understated, beautiful mountain with a strikingly symmetrical summit cone, tucked into a jagged ring of secondary peaks that can obscure its summit from the surrounding valleys.</p>
<p>This exhibit plots a series of photographs taken during an ascent of the mountain from the small hamlet of Lescun, which sits on a broad, sloping mountainside about five miles to the east. The approach route and climbing line are plotted in detail, and each photograph is represented by a dot and a thin line, indicating both the direction that the camera was pointing and offering a rough, interpretive approximation of the photographer's range of view.</p>
